## Short description

-We are building an app where people will share their as well as social problems, will learn about the various human rights in a desirable time and with no cost.
-It will inspire people to shed light on this issue and provide them a starting point to handle difficult situations/incidents.
-It will encourage members of the public to capture incidents that might otherwise go unwitnessed.
-Display patterns and correlations of incidents that can be grouped by time, location, and type to better understand the scenario.


### What's the problem?

If a teacher fails to teach justice to his student, the teacher is fake; if a judge fails to provide justice to his countrymen, the judge is fake; if a country fails to seek justice to its citizen, the country is fake. Who is fake? A raindrop remains pure until it doesn’t fall on the earth.

We cannot expect people to have respect for law and order until we teach respect to those we have entrusted to enforce those laws.

And the sad reality is that, we currently live in an environment where desired authorities interactions with People in case of mis-happenings disproportionately end in unnecessary and avoidable escalation.

Also, the charges we pay to the authorities in order to seek help and understand the Rights we have and steps we should take in case of any mis-happenings. 


### How can technology help?

Legal awareness, is the empowerment of individuals regarding issues involving the law. Legal awareness helps to promote consciousness of legal culture, participation in the formation of laws and the rule of law 
Our platform will provide a right direction to the people by posting the incidents they  went through ,suggest way to tackle them  and seek solutions to the problems they are currently facing .
The idea is to empower communities by capturing similar kind of injustice faced by people around us. The goal is to create a solution that could aid in the avoidance and de-escalation of incidents, and provide visibility and opportunities for people to come up and support others with the experience they gained while tackling the same issue.

1.	Post an Incident 
2.	Search for an Incident 
3.	Get Advice/ raise a query 
4.  IBM Cloudant stores data and gives you result
5. 	Know your rights and Act accordingly

## Project roadmap

1.	There will be three kind of users for “” system
-	Help seekers posting about the issues/incidents happened to him or around.
-	People who will make suggestions to seeker.
-	People who will just share their experiences and steps they took that may help someone else in need. 
2.	Post an Incident 
-Anyone who is going through any dilemma or is feeling awkward while sharing anything happened to him/her can post it and ask for suggestions.

-Here, anyone can share anything that has happened around him and need guidance on what next steps he/she would take. Also, he/she can post anything inspiring that may help other seekers.

3.	Search for an Incident 
Anyone who is not aware of what steps he/she should take in case of mis-happenings and doesn’t have much to pay can search for the prev. Incidents that might have happened and can seek direction/guidance to proceed via others experiences.

4.	Get Advice/ raise a query 
Anyone can post a query as anonymous user and anyone anonymously can answer his/her query.

5.	Know your rights and Act accordingly
Here we have a page where people will get guidance on what all rights do they have and what steps he/she can take as per so and so act.

6.	Get help from an NGO
We have such cases where people may need help financially or they need security. In such cases, they can seek help from various NGOs by posting over there.  


## Future Scope
-Enable members of the public to record incidents through a mobile app in a quick, near real time and safe manner.
-Central map view to enable search & visualization of incident clusters.
-Language translator can you used to have it in multiple languages.
- AI can be used to display most relevant incidents.
